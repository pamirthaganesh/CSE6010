# Boilerplate makefile for Assignment 2
# Feel free to edit or use your own versions if desired.

# Replace 'header1.h', 'header2.h', 'object1.o', 'object2.o', and 'executable'
# with your filenames. It's fine if you only have one header, just delete
# 'header2.h' in that case.


# What compiler do you use? Default is gcc.
CC=gcc

# Your headers go here. It's fine to only have one.
DEPS = solve.h
# List of the object files that will be built. Replace the dummy-files with
# names corresponding to your source files. I.E. if you have source_1.c and
# source_2.c, these would be source_1.o and source_2.o
OBJ =  main_solve.o solve.o 

# This is your actual executable to build. In general, just name this the same
# as whichever .c file has the main() function, with no suffix.
EXE = main_solve
